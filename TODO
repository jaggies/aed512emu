Better implementation of XON/XOFF protocol
	Looks like the device is properly sending XOFF(19) when the buffer is full,
	but the code is ignoring it. Might solve the buffer overrun.

Implement hardware erase 
	This appears to be controlled by the ERASE line from PIA1.
	It appears to use capnoic color to erase the frame during a frame.

Implement x/y scrolling
	It isn't clear from the hardware how this register interacts with memory or zoom.
	This is required for proper text scrolling.

	See CURC in listing.

Implement x/y zoom

Figure out parallel interface (hstctl 0x25)
